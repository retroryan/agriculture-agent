When the agent recognizes a well-known city or coordinates, it calls tools like:

1. For "Chicago weather":
   get_weather_forecast(
       location="Chicago",
       latitude=41.88,
       longitude=-87.63,
       days=7

2. For "coordinates 40.7128, -74.0060":
   get_weather_forecast(

This bypasses the geocoding API for faster, more reliable results!
