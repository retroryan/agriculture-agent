This document summarizes the cleanup performed to make the demo simpler and more focused.

## Changes Made

### 1. **Simplified config.py**

- Reduced from 120+ lines to 53 lines

### 2. **Cleaned up shared/base.py**
- Removed example patterns dictionary
- Simplified graph creation function
- Renamed `create_standard_graph` to `create_tool_graph` for clarity
- Reduced from 215 lines to 107 lines

### 3. **Streamlined chatbot examples**
- **basic_tools/chatbot_with_tools.py**: Reduced from 175 to 58 lines
- **external_tools/chatbot_with_fetch.py**: Reduced from 146 to 60 lines
- Removed duplicate code and custom agent functions
- Both now use the same clean pattern

### 4. **Focused tool_chaining_demo.py**
- Reduced from 207 to 119 lines
